## Question 1
**Recovery Time**
Suppose we want to understand the relationship between recovery time after surgery based on an patient's prior fitness. You will group patients into three fitness levels: below average, average, above average. 
**Assignment:**
Using 1-way ANOVA: 
- Explain if you are in better shape before surgery, does it take less time to recover? 
- Explain the experimental design used to implement 1-way ANOVA and report any interaction effects you find.
- If the design of the experiment has a full-factorial design would this improve the outcome of the experimenter's decisions, why or why not?

## Question 2
**Kidney Failure**
After kidney failure, we suppose that the time of stay in hospital depends on weight gain between treatments and duration of treatment.

We will model the log number of days as a function of the other two factors.

Variable	Description: 
- Days: Duration of hospital stay
- Weight: How much weight is gained?
- Duration:	How long under treatment for kidney problems? (two levels)

What are the main effects for the grouping variables used in this analysis?
Are there interaction effects? If so, explain what they are and interpret the outcome. Hint: use appropriate interaction plots and explain how we may interpret any present interactions that were found in the study.

## Question 3
**Soda**

**Observations:** for 6 brands of soda, we recorded the sodium content of 8 and 12 ounce bottles. 
- How much sodium is there in North American soda? 
- How much does this vary by brand? 
- Determine which effects should be considered fixed and which should be considered random.
- What is the “grand mean” sodium content? 
- How much variability is there from brand to brand? 
- What experimental design would you propose? 
- Does a full factorial design make sense in this analysis, why or why not?

**Extra credit:** If '1' represents Coke'Cola under brand and '2' represents Pepsi, can you determine which brand has higher sodium content? Why or why not?
