##**Question 1 **-
**Recovery Time**
Suppose we want to understand the relationship between recovery time after surgery based on an patient's prior fitness. You will group patients into three fitness levels: below average, average, above average. 
**Assignment:**
Using 1-way ANOVA: 
- Explain if you are in better shape before surgery, does it take less time to recover? 
- Explain the experimental design used to implement 1-way ANOVA and report any interaction effects you find.
- If the design of the experiment has a full-factorial design would this improve the outcome of the experimenter's decisions, why or why not?
